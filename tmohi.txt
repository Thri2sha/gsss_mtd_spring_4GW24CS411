diNo one can tell me,      
Nobody know, 
where the wind comes
from,
where the windgoes
                         It's flying from somewhere 
                            As fast as it can,
                         I couldn't keep up wiht it,
                         Not if I ran,
But if I stopped holing 
The string of my kite 
It would blow with the wind
for a day and night.
                          and then when I found it,
                          wherever it blew 
                          I should know that the wind
                          Had been going there too.
So then i could tell them
When the wind goes...
But where the wind come from
Nobody knows.
